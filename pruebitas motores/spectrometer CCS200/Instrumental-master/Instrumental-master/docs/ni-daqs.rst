NI DAQs
=======

.. toctree::

This module has been developed using an NI USB-6221 -- the code should generally work for all DAQmx boards, but I'm sure there are plenty of compatibility bugs just waiting for you wonderful users to find and fix.

First, make sure you have NI's DAQmx software installed. Instrumental will then use NiceLib to generate bindings from the header it finds.

The ``NIDAQ`` class lets you interact with your board and all its various inputs
and outputs in a fairly simple way. Let's say you've hooked up digital I/O P1.0
to analog input AI0, and your analog out AO1 to analog input AI1::

    >>> from instrumental.drivers.daq.ni import NIDAQ, list_instruments
    >>> list_instruments()
    [<NIDAQ 'Dev0'>]
    >>> daq = NIDAQ('Dev0')
    >>> daq.ai0.read()
    <Quantity(0.0154385786803, 'volt)>
    >>> daq.port1[0].write(True)
    >>> daq.ai0.read()
    <Quantity(5.04241962841, 'volt')>
    >>> daq.ao1.write('2.1V')
    >>> daq.ai1.read()
    <Quantity(2.10033320744, 'volt')>

Now let's try using digital input. Assume P1.1 is attached to P1.2::

    >>> daq.port1[1].write(False)
    >>> daq.port1[2].read()
    False
    >>> daq.port1[1].write(True)
    >>> daq.port1[2].read()
    True

Let's read and write more than one bit at a time. To write to multiple lines
simultaneously, pass an unsigned int to ``write()``. The line with the lowest
index corresponds to the lowest bit, and so on. If you read from multiple
lines, read() returns an int. Connect P1.0-3 to P1.4-7::

   >>> daq.port1[0:3].write(5)  # 0101 = decimal 5
   >>> daq.port1[4:7].read()  # Note that the last index IS included
   5
   >>> daq.port1[7:4].read()  # This flips the ordering of the bits
   10                         # 1010 = decimal 10
   >>> daq.port1[0].write(False)  # Zero the ones bit individually
   >>> daq.port1[4:7].read()  # 0100 = decimal 4
   4

You can also read and write arrays of buffered data. Use the same ``read()`` and
``write()`` methods, just include your timing info (and pass in the data as an
array if writing). When writing, you must provide either `freq` or `fsamp`, and
may provide either `duration` or `reps` to specify for how long the waveform is
output. For example, there are many ways to output the same sinusoid::

    >>> from instrumental import u
    >>> from numpy import pi, sin, linspace
    >>> data = sin( 2*pi * linspace(0, 1, 100, endpoint=False) )*5*u.V + 5*u.V
    >>> daq.ao0.write(data, duration='1s', freq='500Hz')
    >>> daq.ao0.write(data, duration='1s', fsamp='50kHz')
    >>> daq.ao0.write(data, reps=500, freq='500Hz')
    >>> daq.ao0.write(data, reps=500, fsamp='50kHz')

Note the use of ``endpoint=False`` in ``linspace``. This ensures we don't
repeat the start/end point (0V) of our sine waveform when outputting more than
one period.

All this stuff is great for simple tasks, but sometimes you may want to perform
input and output on multiple channels simultaneously. To accomplish this we need
to use Tasks.

.. NOTE::
    Tasks in the `ni` module are similar, but not the same as Tasks in DAQmx
    (and PyDAQmx). Our Tasks allow you to quickly and easily perform simultaneous
    input and output with one Task without the hassle of having to create multiple
    and hook their timing and triggers up.

Here's an example of how to perform simultaneous input and output::

    >>> from instrumental.drivers.daq.ni import NIDAQ, Task
    >>> from instrumental import u
    >>> from numpy import linspace
    >>> daq = NIDAQ('Dev0')
    >>> task = Task(daq.ao0, daq.ai0)
    >>> task.set_timing(duration='1s', fsamp='10Hz')
    >>> write_data = {'ao0': linspace(0, 9, 10) * u.V}
    >>> task.run(write_data)
    {u'ai0': <Quantity([  1.00000094e+01   1.89578724e-04   9.99485542e-01   2.00007917e+00
       3.00034866e+00   3.99964556e+00   4.99991698e+00   5.99954114e+00
       6.99981625e+00   7.99976941e+00], 'volt')>,
     u't': <Quantity([ 0.   0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9], 'second')>}

As you can see, we create a dict as input to the ``run()`` method. Its keys are
the names of the input channels, and its values are the corresponding array
Quantities that we want to write.  Similarly, the ``run()`` returns a dict that
contains the input that was read.  This dict also contains the time data under
key 't'. Note that the read and write happen concurrently, so each voltage read
has not yet moved to its new setpoint.

There may be applications where data needs to be acquired continuously. This can be achieved by setting up a ``Task`` object in 'continuous' mode.

Here is an example of how to perform continuous sampling::

   from instrumental.drivers.daq.ni import NIDAQ, Task
   daq = NIDAQ('Dev0') # Or whatever is shown from instrumental.list_instruments()
   task = daq.Task(daq.ai0, daq.ai1)
   task.set_timing(fsamp='100 Hz', n_samples=1000, mode='continuous')
   task.start()
   done = False
   while not done:
       data = task.read()
       # do something with the data
       # do something to eventually set done = True
   task.stop()

Once set, ``data`` will contain a dictionary. Its keys are the names of input channels, and values are the corresponding array Quantities. The dictionary also contains time data under key 't'. The length of each of the arrays in this dictionary will be between 0 and ``n_samples`` elements. Therefore, you do not need to worry about syncronizing the timing of your ``read()`` calls, as each ``read()`` call will only return the data returned since the last call to ``read()``, or since the task started. To avoid unexpected behavior, ensure that your code calls ``task.read()`` frequently enough so that the daq never completely fills the ``n_samples``-sized buffer.
